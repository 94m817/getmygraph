Folder - Boot:

Contains the c code to transfer data via the porocessor to the FPGA.
Copy the code to home/xillydemo/demoapps.
This folder has a makefile. add the names of the files to the list in the make file and run the type make at terminal.

If any old executables  exist in the folder, run Make clean.

In order to send/get data to the FPGA, run the executable as  ./swdemo(or  ./srdemo) and pass the required arguments. Details on the arguments are in the respective c files.


Folder Boot-Bk:

Contains the FPGA configuration file that has to be copied to the sdcard in which the xillinux installation exists.
Each folder has a .bin file and a .bit file. Change the name of the .bin file to boot.bin and copy it to the SDCard in order to configure the FPGA as described by the folder name.

The .bit file is required to create the .bin file. On ur PC, copy the .bit file to the boot folder in the xillinux evaluation kit provided by xilybus.
Once copied, open command prompt and run makeboot.bat. Make sure that the environment variables for xilinx have been set.

Folder vhdl:

Contains the VHDL project for xillybus along with a default code to use the FIFOs.

Note:
1) The xillybus project requires that you always create a .bin file and copy it to the SDCard. There's no way as of now,
to use JTAG or any other option to configure the FPGA.

2) Requirements: It is xpected that you have a copy of the xillybus Xillinux files provided by Xillybus in your PC.
